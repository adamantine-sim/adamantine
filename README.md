# adamantine
`adamantine` stands for *AD*ditive (*A*) *MAN*unifac*T*uring s*I*mulator (*NE*).
It is an open-source sofware to simulate heat transfer for additive manufacturing.

## Installation
Installing `adamantine` requires:
* MPI
* A compiler that support C++17
* CMake: 3.15 or later
* Boost: 1.70.0 or later
* ArborX: 1.4.1 or later
* Trilinos: 14.4.0 or later
* deal.II: 9.5 or later

You need to compile deal.II with MPI, P4EST, and ArborX. If you want to use Exodus file, you also need Trilinos with SEACAS support.
`adamantine` also optionally supports profiling through [Caliper](https://github.com/llnl/Caliper).

An example on how to install all the dependencies can be found in
`ci/Dockerfile`.

To configure `adamantine` use:
```CMake
cmake \
  -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -D DEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/dealii \
  -DBOOST_DIR=/path/to/boost \
/path/to/source/dir
```
Then simply use `make`. This will compile `adamantine` and create an executable
in a newly created `bin` subdirectory. You will find in this subdirectory the
executable and an example of input files.

The list of configuration options is:
* ADAMANTINE\_ENABLE\_ADIAK=ON/OFF
* ADAMANTINE\_ENABLE\_CALIPER=ON/OFF
* ADAMANTINE\_ENABLE\_COVERAGE=ON/OFF
* ADAMANTINE\_ENABLE\_TESTS=ON/OFF
* BOOST\_DIR=/path/to/boost
* CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug/Release
* CALIPER\_DIR=/path/to/caliper (optional)
* DEAL\_II\_DIR=/path/to/dealii

## Docker 
The Docker image containing the latest version of `adamantine` can be pulled
using
```bash
docker pull rombur/adamantine:latest
```

## Run
After compiling `adamantine`, you can run a simulation using
```bash
mpirun -n 2 ./adamantine --input-file=input.info
```
Note that the name of the input file is totally arbitrary, `my_input_file` is as
valid as `input.info`.

There is a [known bug](https://github.com/adamantine-sim/adamantine/issues/130)
when using multithreading. To deactivate multithreading use
```bash
export DEAL_II_NUM_THREADS=1
```
If you use our Docker image, the variable is already set.

### Scan path
`adamantine` supports two kinds of scan path input: the `segment` format and the
`event` format.
#### Segment format
After the self-explainatory tree-line header, the column descriptions are:
* Column 1: mode 0 for line mode, mode 1 for spot mode
* Columns 2 to 4: (x,y,z) coordinates in units of m. For line mode, this
is the ending position of the the line.
* Column 5: the coefficient for the nominal power. Usually this is either
0 or 1, but sometimes intermediate values are used when turning a corner.
* Column 6: in spot mode, this is the dwell time in seconds, in line mode
this is the velocity in m/s.

The first entry must be a spot. If it was a line, there would be no way
to know where the line starts (since the coordinates are the ending coordinates).
By convention, we avoid using a zero second dwell time for the first spot
and instead choose some small positive number.
#### Event format
For an event series the first segment is a point, then the rest are lines.
The column descriptions are:
* Column 1: segment endtime
* Columns 2 to 4: (x,y,z) coordinates in units of m. This is the ending
position of the line.
* Column 5: the coefficient for the nominal power. Usually this is either
0 or 1, but sometimes intermediate values are used when turning a corner.

### Material deposition
`adamantine` supports two ways to deposit material: based on the scan path and based on a separate material deposition file.

#### Scan-path-based deposition
If the material deposition is based on the scan path, then material is added according to the `deposition\_length`, `deposition\_width`, `deposition\_height`, `deposition\_lead\_time`, and `deposition\_time` input parameters in the `geometry` input block. Cells are activated if they are crossed by a rectangular prism (rectangle in 2D) traveling along the scan path. In 3D the rectangular prism is centered with the (x,y) values of the scan path and the top of the rectangular prism is at the z value of the scan path (i.e. the scan path height gives the new height of the material after deposition). Near the end of segments, the length of the rectangular prism is truncated so as to not deposit material past the edge of the segment. Material can be deposited with a lead time ahead of the heat source (controlled by `deposition\_lead\_time`). Depositing material requires modifying the simulation mesh, which can be computationally intensive. To reduce the cost, material can be added in "lumps", with the time between lumps set by `deposition\_time`.  

#### File-based deposition
The material deposition can also be set by boxes defined in a separate file. The format of this file is as follows.

The first entry of the file is the dimension the problem: 2 or 3.
* For 2D problems, the column descriptions are:
  * Column 1 to 2: (x,y) coordinates of the center of the deposition box in m.
  * Column 3 to 4: (x,y) length of deposition box in m.
  * Column 5: deposition time in s.
  * Column 6: angle of material deposition.
* For 3D problems, the column descriptions are:
  * Column 1 to 3: (x,y,z) coordinates of the center of the deposition box in m.
  * Column 4 to 6: (x,y,z) length of deposition box in m.
  * Column 7: deposition time in s.
  * Column 6: angle of material deposition.
