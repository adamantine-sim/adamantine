# Contributing

Contributing to adamantine is easy. Just send us a [pullrequest](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
When you send your request, make `master` the destination branch on the [adamantine repository](https://github.com/adamantine-sim/adamantine).

Your pull request must pass adamantine's tests before being merged into the `master` branch. These tests are (usually) performed automatically through the continuous integration (CI) testing integrated into adamantine's GitHub repository.
