# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  adamantine is a software for simulating additive manufacturing. It can simulate the heat field during the manufacturing process and the phase change that the material undergoes. The addition of material is done using element activation. Experimental data can be used to improve the simulation through the use of Ensemble Kalman filter.
